<p id="description">A simple and responsive Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator built with React and Tailwind CSS. It helps users quickly calculate their BMI based on their weight (kg) and height (m) showing results instantly with a smooth and minimal UI. 🚀 Features ⚡ Real-time BMI calculation 🎨 Clean and modern UI using Tailwind CSS 📱 Fully responsive design 🧾 Displays BMI value up to 2 decimal places 💡 Simple and beginner-friendly React component structure 🧩 Tech Stack React.js – Component-based UI Tailwind CSS – Styling and layout JavaScript (ES6) – Logic and functionality 💻 How to Run Locally # Clone this repository git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-calculator.git # Go into the project folder cd bmi-calculator # Install dependencies npm install # Start the development server npm run dev Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173/ (or the link shown in terminal). 📊 Example Output Weight: 70 kg Height: 1.75 m Your BMI: 22.86 ✅ Normal weight range 🌟 Future Improvements Add BMI category display (Underweight Normal Overweight Obese) Include metric/imperial unit toggle</p>


  
  
<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   🚀 Features 🧮 Accurate BMI Calculation – Calculates BMI instantly using weight (kg) and height (m). ⚡ Real-time Input Handling – Updates and computes as soon as values are entered. 🎨 Modern & Clean UI – Styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek and minimal look. 📱 Responsive Design – Works smoothly on desktop tablet and mobile screens. 💾 Lightweight & Fast – Built with pure React no extra dependencies. 🔢 Rounded Results – Displays BMI up to 2 decimal places for precision. 💡 Beginner Friendly Code – Easy-to-understand structure for React learners. 🧾 Validation – Alerts users when weight or height inputs are invalid. 🌙 Dark Theme – Elegant dark background with smooth color contrast. Would you like me to add “Future Enhancements” (e.g. BMI category display chart or health tips) too? It’ll make your README look more professional.
